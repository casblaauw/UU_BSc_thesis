# UU BSc thesis
The code for my thesis to cap off my bachelor in Molecular Life Sciences, on dynamic eQTLs in C. elegans during development and heat stress. Work in progress.

* [DynaQTLs_mapping.Rmd](DynaQTLs_mapping.Rmd): Code to map dynamic eQTLs from the data deposited in [WormQTL2](https://www.bioinformatics.nl/EleQTL/?mode=download). 
  * Also provides permuted mapping for statistical significance and hyperparameter tuning.
* [DynaQTLs_plotting.Rmd](DynaQTLs_plotting.Rmd): Code to visualise the eQTLs globally and selected dynamics locally.
